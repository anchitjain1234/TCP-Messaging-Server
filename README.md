# Select based TCP messaging server
This repository contains code for basic **concurrent TCP messaging server** which reads client request using **select system call** and iterates over them rather than creating a child process for every client.

##### Compiling
* Type following command to generate executable __server__
    ``` sh
    $ make
    ```
##### Running
* To run __server__ type
    ``` sh
    $ ./server <port>
    ```
    __port__ is the port number on which TCP messaging server will listen requests. Default port is 6500.
* **Telnet** could be used as *client* application. To run __client__ through telnet type following command
    ``` sh
    $ telnet localhost <port>
    ```
    __port__ is the port number on which TCP messaging server is running.
* To **add** a client to a **particular group** type the following message in telnet
    ```sh
    GROUP$<ID>
    ```
    here **ID** is the group number to which client should be added.Value of ID       could be from 0 to MAX_GROUPS defined in header.  
    For e.g. typing
    ```sh
    GROUP$2
    ```
    will add the client to group number 2.
* To **send** the message to all the **clients in a group** type following message in telnet
    ```sh
    GROUP$<ID>$<MSG>
    ```
    here **ID** is the group number to which message should be sent and **MSG** is message to be sent.
    For e.g. typing
    ```sh
    GROUP$2$AASD
    ```
    will send AASD to all the clients present in group 2.
* To **send** the message to **all the clients** connected irrespective of group type the message directly in telnet.  
    For e.g. typing
    ```sh
    asad
    ```
    will send asad to all the clients connected.

##### Basic Explanation
* Client connects to server. Server adds client's file descriptor into an array.
* Clients send messages to server to which server responds by selecting file descriptors iteratively through select system all.
* If client requests to be added in a group add client's file descriptor into a 2D array of groupinfo having row as group number and column having client's file descriptors.
* If message is to be sent to all the clients in a group iterate through that group's row in groupinfo array and send message to all the clients.
* If message is to be sent to all the clients iterate through file descriptor array and send message to all the clients.
##### TODOS
* Add command to remove client from group.
